# crm_django_project

Hi, this is all about [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) , a web framework for perfectionists with deadlines!

Django is a full-stack, open-source Python framework designed for efficient web development.

This is learning by doing: I am this course from [Dennis Ivy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dennis-ivanov/):

> Django (3.0) (Crash Course Tutorials | Customer Management App)[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-51WBLyFTg2vW-_6XBoUpE7vpmoR3ztO]

## What exactly is CRM?
Customer relationship management (CRM) is a technology for managing all your company's relationships and interactions with customers and potential customers. The goal is simple: Improve business relationships. A CRM system helps companies stay connected to customers, streamline processes, and improve profitability.

Why Django?

Django is a high-level Python web framework 
that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. 

Built by experienced developers, it takes care of much 
of the hassle of web development, so you can focus on writing 
your app without needing to reinvent the wheel. 
Itâ€™s free and open source.
